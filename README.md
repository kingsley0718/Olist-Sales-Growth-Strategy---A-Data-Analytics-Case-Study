# Olist E-commerce RFM Analysis & 20% Revenue Growth Plan
## Overview
This project analyzes the Olist e-commerce dataset (Brazil) to identify revenue drivers and design actionable strategies to grow revenue by ≥20%. I built an RFM segmentation in Power BI, explored temporal and geographic purchasing patterns, and translated the findings into a prioritized growth plan (campaigns, bundles, timing, and city targeting).

**Why it matters**: Most customers purchase only once and the bulk of revenue sits with “at-risk” and “low-frequency” cohorts. Knowing who to target, when, and with what offer is the fastest way to lift revenue.

## Business Goal
**Increase revenue by at least 20%.**

I translate analytical findings into concrete actions (reactivation, cross-sell, city-level targeting, timing-based promos, and review/delivery fixes).


## Dataset
**Source: **Olist Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset (Kaggle)
Tables used: customers, orders, products, order_reviews, (plus date/time fields derived in Power BI), order_items, order_payments,  geolocation, sellers
Rows (approx): ~100k orders, ~96k customers
Cleaning & prep (Power Query):
Fixed data types (dates/times, numeric).
Created Order Status from delivery timestamps.
Handled missing/unknown product categories (kept as “Unknown” for honesty).
Built a clean Date table for time intelligence.
